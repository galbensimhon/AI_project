* requests
* beautifulsoup4
* scikit_learn

**this project also includes some folders**
* web_scrapper - calculate the databases by scarping
* databases - all databases
* databases_processing - converting databses to numbers
* utils - helper functions

## Getting Started

There are several options to run the project:
* **Run python iteration.py without additional parameters:**   
will cause selection of 20 different random games, finding the optimal lineup for the first team, and emitting different graphs
* **Run python iteration.py with two parameters (2 names of team from Premier League):**   
will find the optimal composition for the first team.  
(for example python iteration.py Chelsea Everton - will find the optimal team for Chelsea with the best chance of beating Everton)

and last thing of course: 
Have Fun !! :)
